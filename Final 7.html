<p>
Buwan ng Wika made me learn to be proud of my Filipino culture and heritage, its long and complex history and beliefs, is something to be proud of. Things like the Filipiniana, talumpati, tula, kundiman, and much more, show the efforts and joy of being a Filipino, hence why I learned we should celebrate it wholeheartedly and with pride. I can apply this by respecting and learning the different traditions and culture. Respecting tribes whenever we visit, and also bringing honor by wearing the appropriate cultural clothes whenever it is buwan ng wika. 

Even though I did not directly participate in any event, I did join by presenting my declamation about Luha for a Filipino performance! I also participated by wearing appropriate Filipiniana. I would first of all start off by saying the history and culture of Filipinos, as it would enlighten them why weâ€™re celebrating Buwan ng Wika in the first place. It is important to have this event as it lets you show off your Filipino pride and beliefs, honoring our ancestors and their stories.

<p>
Science month taught me the importance of using technology and innovations to create art works and other inventions helping in society. An example is WINS corner, we used the ideas of the class to bring our starry night creation to life. I can apply this by using the most of my creativity and originality, to help me, my society, and my close ones. I actively participated in this event by helping and managing WINS corner, as well as making a poster to spread awareness of the good of technology when used wisely.

I would teach this to a friend by explaining the benefits of handwashing, toothbrushing, and also listening to the ideas of people, to let society know each and every bright mind and goal. This event is important in Science because Science is the subject of researching, learning, and coming up with experiments and innovations to make the world a better place. So instilling it among young students, sparkens their mind at a young age to help our community.

<p>
Intrams 2025 taught me how to enhance my skills, physically and mentally. It helped me realize that to always give my best, and even if I lose, atleast I know that I tried my hardest. It made me learn that I should help my teammates, but also respect my enemies. We can apply this even in real life, like in other competitions or even work. Try and do your best, help your co-workers, and respect rivalries, but always remember to have fun.

I would teach this by letting them compete to experience the adrenaline and fun. If she can't join, I'd explain to them the different games of Intrams, like basketball, volleyball, and their importance. I joined in sack race, and even though it's a quick game, I did enjoy because of cheers and my teammates. This is important to let learners remember how helpful collaboration, cooperation, and making new friends are in this often lonely world.

<p>
As a daughter of a historian, AP month is important as it not only learns the history of Philippines, it also respects the culture of every single country. Here, we get to dress up culturally and honor different regions or continents. AP month isn't only helpful to learn about the different histories, flags, and even facts about countries, it also made me realize how diverse yet united the different countries are.

I would teach this to my friends by teaching them how to properly and appropriately respect the different cultures of countries. Such as teaching the basic manners there, their traditional clothes, or even a bit of their language! And I participated by doing an editorial to spread awareness about the different issues affecting each country greatly. I also listened to their seminar, and answered their quizbees and tests. Overall, AP month is important as we unite as one, even how different the countries and their beliefs are.

<p>
Teacher's Day made me learn to appreciate my teachers more, as they work hard daily, grading assignments, creating quizzes all while worrying over their students. It made me realize how underpaid they are, how all their efforts are sometimes overlooked, so teacher's day is an important day to them. It is important because we get to thank our second family properly, with them having a break for once.

I would teach my friends to be grateful for all kinds of teachers, strict, kind, young, or old, as in the end, they're still human, and they're doing their job to help make students be better. I participated by making games for the program, and even treating the teachers to prizes from the fun games. In conclusion, it is a crucial day for teachers, as they finally get to see how their hard work paid off.
