Throught LPSci, I made new friends, and strengthened my old ones. In my old school, Seton, I had many friends, but hardly any true ones. But in LPSci, I learned the true meaning and real experience of having genuine, kind, smart, and funny friends. My closest friends are Zoe, Romina, Viv, Chiara, Keisha, Bianca, and Nina ^^ Of course, my friends are also Jadee, Riley, Emman, Taranee, Grace, Chloie, Aya, Benj, Maeur, Renz, and Martin.

We became friends in Grade 6, but we've known each other since Grade 4. She's a Setonian like me, and we clicked because of similar interests like sitcoms, anime, and card games! Then when we both switched to LPSci, we grew closer even if we were different sections. She's my closest friend, my Max Verstappen to  Daniel Riccardo, and I'm really lucky to have her as a best friend, as she's helped me in rough times, but also cheered at my highest.

We met in Grade 7, but became closer at Grade 8. My musical-lover friend, the ever so crafty and kind Romina, I'm so glad to have her whenever I feel like crying, or vice veras (I'd lend a shoulder to her), or just to enjoy and laugh while we cherish more memories.

We met in Grade 8 and became close friends that later year. I realized she was obsessed with Hamilton and anime like me, so we watched both the movies to that together!! I feel bad whenever she gets excused because of research or journalism, so I always try my best to maybe lighten the school load by simply being present and listening to her rants.

Friends since Grade 7, I'm so lucky to have a kind, caring, smart, and ever so pretty vice president as one of my closest friends. She's always there for me, for my rants, questions, or just when I need someone to listen to. And I'm here for her whenever her responsibilities get too many, or she has feelings she needs to let out.

Viv, a friend since Grade 2. We just got separated when you moved to America. But got closer when you came back at Grade 4, and honestly the rest is history. I thank her for being there whenever I have problems in schools, so I'm always there for her in terms of life problems.

The best seatmate I could have asked for, I'm so lucky to have a wise, kind, and so talented friend. At Grade 7, I was in awe of your dancing and intelligence, so I'm actually really happy we got closer together, and being your seatmate, such a fun and amazing experience ^^

One of the kindest and prettiest girls I've ever met, I actually really wanted to be friends with her since Grade 7, and I'm so glad we became closer. I thank her for the notes, answers to my question, and also just being there to listen. I'm lucky to be friends with her.

At the end, I learned the importance of true and genuine friends. And I'm grateful for each and every single one of them. Because without them, I probably would be so lost in life, so I'm glad to have them to guide me. Memorable experiences include Zoe's birthday, not a lot of people, but that made it even more enjoyable. I got to by myself without anyone judging, because they too were themselves! Another is whenever my friends from Accountability go to malls or a house of someone, because we usually play truth or dare, and then it gets emotional because everyone says some of their deepest thoughts. And last and most recently, nutrichant. For the start of the school year, that was a great eye-opener. Even with the non-stop practice and assignments, it was such an unforgettable experience. Everyone trying their best, everyone stressing out, and everyone crying when we got called champions.
