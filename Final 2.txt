My favorite color is blue! I love shades of blue, any items such as clothes (Like here), merch, keychains, or etc. I also like accents of purple, especially since it pairs well with blue.

My favorite sitcom ever is Brooklyn Nine, the mix of comedy yet deep topics like misognyny, racism, and homophobism. I learned so much about the police in the US and their issues, how they worked together in their own different ways to solve cases. I laughed at the iconic duos and their tight bonds, but also cried at their sincere friendships. I probably rewatched it atleast 5 times! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtRa82x1BwQdnpHf0Es4gcQ" target="_blank"> Watch some episodes here! </a>

A very diverse set of movies, yes. I love Legally Blonde due to the women empowerment, that if Elle Woods can balance being healthy and fit, while staying smart, and having true friends, then I can do it too. It's one of those movies that I watch when I need to be motivated and feel better. Knives out on the other hand, well, I love mystery in general. I love the adrenaline when solving crimes and mysteries, so knives out really makes me think, which I love! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWOHwI_FgAo" target="_blank"> Trailer of Legally Blonde! </a> <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=5555fc7198e53737&sxsrf=AE3TifNhWRUDeIcO-yxCYb6QMWXFvLnf3A:1760884862497&q=knives+out&source=lnms&fbs=AIIjpHz30rPMyW-0vSP0k1VTNmO_kCOARpjPjQRkBWH2HwUIz5XUSIJvSK0oms7XOxizDlmapc3S9dUP-_MTiIHH95WkmU3OJ0Y1hJaAJdBCt0P7bfmzdEjKwYZ8G0dxHpKwLwHJut2izkqnx-71uXW69hylej6QAGjJ6O1JcsupgHyTMZ02EfO2vfwdGvKGKfmqlO-ueRzdJCzdc14ugVaV_mtPsLmHywTk04lA1Cq0fr9ftiRbZAU&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwirxOClv7CQAxU4dvUHHUqmKJwQ0pQJegQICRAB&biw=1280&bih=665&dpr=1.5#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:406e1c82,vid:qGqiHJTsRkQ,st:0" target="_blank"> Trailer of Knives Out </a>

I absolutely love cats and ducks. I don't have a pet, but if I were to get one, I'd get a duck or a cat. They're so cute, and honestly, so silly!

I love burgers, chicken nuggets, and fries, but most especially sinigang na baboy. I love it especially when it's cold outside, becaused the sour taste as a soup is such a delicious combination. Especially if it's home made, or made by my yaya, my number 1 food :))

Based on the music here, I love Hamilton. I was introduced to it around 2 years ago, and I fell in love with it immediately. I loved the music, the actors and actresses on Broadway, and Lin Manuel Miranda's writing. I adore the diversity of the music genres and lyrics, then paired with historical lessons, makes me yearn to watch it in real life.
