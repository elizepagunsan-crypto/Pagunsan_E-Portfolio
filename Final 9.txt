<p>
Lesson 1 taught me what CSS is, its importance and its functions. Facts like it stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and that it helps save time for everyone because it separates content from design.

<p>
Lesson 2 taught me the different types of CSS, also known as inline, embdedded, and external. External is best for large or long HTML webpages, inline is applied directly to the element, and embedded is applied in the head tag and it has a closing tag for style. It has different syntaxes, inline follows style="property:value;", embedded is element {property:value;}, and then external is link rel="stylesheet"

<div class="text-box">
<p>
Lesson 3 taught me about the display properties. Block level elements have a vertical display, taking as much space as possible, it also starts as line break between elements. Examples are headings, paragraphs, and lists. Inline elements have a horizontal display, and doesn't start a line break between elements. Examples of inline are links! Part of block elements are div tags, they style sections on your webpage, and have a line break before and after. However, span tags are inline elements, and used to emphasize words in a sentence.

<div class="image-text"> <img src="d.png" alt="Lesson 4" class="side-photo">
<div class="text-box">
<p>
Lesson 4 taught me that a CSS rule has 2 main parts. There are selectors, and one or more style declarations (Property and value). Properties can be about fonts, colors, lists, and even more. Classes are defined by dots and help style various elements at once, as they set can also set formatting rules on a certain element you pick. If it's just class name, the class can apply to any element, however you can pair it with an element so it only sets the formatting rule to that element.

<div class="image-text"> <img src="e.png" alt="Lesson 5" class="side-photo">
<div class="text-box">
<p>
Lesson 5, which are about selectors let me learn about the different types of selectors and their purpose. There are class selectors, element selector/tag selector, ID selectors, group selectors, attribute selectors, and universal selectors. Element selector applies CSS through all the elements you picked, ID selector applies CSS to one element, universal selector selects every single HTML element on the page with the asterisk, group selector is similar to element but now you can select multiple elements and apply CSS to them, and then attribute selector selects elements based on certain attribute values.

<div class="image-text"> <img src="f.png" alt="Lesson 6" class="side-photo">
<div class="text-box">
<p>
Lesson 6 talks about how CSS can be used to set dimensions such as visibility (If it is visible on the webpage), width (horizontal size) or height (vertical size) of HTML elements. They can be used to set the minimum and maximum of certain elements. There are also pseudo-classes, anchor tag having 4 pseudo-classes, link (unvisited), visited (Already visited), hover (When hovered), and active (When clicked). You use {...} for pseudo-classes.
